AI generated howto (claude). It is quite long. 


 I'll help you install tuntox on Termux. Tuntox allows you to create secure tunnels through the Tox network.

Here are the steps:

1. First update your packages:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pkg install git make clang libtoxcore-dev pkg-config
```

3. Clone the tuntox repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjedeer/tuntox.git
```

4. Navigate into the directory:
```bash
cd tuntox
```

5. Compile and install:
```bash
make
```

If you get any errors during compilation related to missing headers or libraries, make sure all dependencies are properly installed.

Note: You'll need root access to use tuntox as it requires creating TUN/TAP interfaces. In Termux, this means you'll need a rooted device or to be running in a Linux environment through proot-distro.

Would you like me to explain how to use tuntox after installation?

 I apologize again. You're right. Let me provide the correct instructions for Termux:

1. First install the basic build tools:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install git make clang pkg-config autoconf automake libtool libsodium
```

2. Clone and build toxcore:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore.git
cd c-toxcore
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
```

3. Then proceed with tuntox:
```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/gjedeer/tuntox.git
cd tuntox
make
```

If you encounter any specific error messages during the process, please share them and I'll help you resolve them. The compilation might take some time depending on your device's capabilities.

Note: Since Termux's package availability can change over time, if you encounter any missing dependencies during compilation, please let me know the specific error messages.
 You're absolutely right - I should provide complete instructions for building all dependencies from source when they're not available in Termux's repositories. Let me analyze this properly:

1. First, basic build tools:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install git make clang pkg-config autoconf automake libtool
```

2. For opus (audio codec library):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiph/opus.git
cd opus
./autogen.sh
# If autogen.sh isn't present or fails, try:
autoreconf -fi
./configure
make
make install
cd ..
```

3. Since libsodium is available in Termux:
```bash
pkg install libsodium
```

4. Now for toxcore (which depends on opus and libsodium):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore.git
cd c-toxcore
./autogen.sh
./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/pkgconfig
make
make install
cd ..
```

5. Finally tuntox:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjedeer/tuntox.git
cd tuntox
make
```

Let me verify if I missed any dependencies:
- opus requires:
  - pkg-config (available in Termux)
  - autoconf (available in Termux)
  - automake (available in Termux)
  - libtool (available in Termux)

- toxcore requires:
  - libsodium (available in Termux)
  - opus (we build from source)
  - pkg-config (available in Termux)
  - autoconf (available in Termux)
  - automake (available in Termux)
  - libtool (available in Termux)

- tuntox requires:
  - toxcore (we build from source)
  - pkg-config (available in Termux)
  - make (available in Termux)
  - clang (available in Termux)

Would you like me to check any specific dependency further or add any missing ones I might have overlooked?

 Let me fix that. The error occurs because the configure script can't find the ar (archiver) tool. We need to specify it explicitly. Here's the corrected build process:

1. Basic build tools:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install git make clang pkg-config autoconf automake libtool binutils
```

2. For opus:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiph/opus.git
cd opus
./autogen.sh
# If autogen.sh isn't present or fails, try:
autoreconf -fi
./configure
make
make install
cd ..
```

3. Install libsodium:
```bash
pkg install libsodium
```

4. Now for toxcore with explicit ar specification:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore.git
cd c-toxcore
./autogen.sh
./configure AR=ar PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/pkgconfig
make
make install
cd ..
```

5. Finally tuntox:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjedeer/tuntox.git
cd tuntox
make
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `binutils` package which provides the `ar` tool
2. Added `AR=ar` to the configure command for toxcore

If you encounter any other errors, please share them and I'll help resolve them.

 The error occurs because the git submodules weren't initialized. Let me fix the instructions:

1. Basic build tools:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install git make clang pkg-config autoconf automake libtool binutils
```

2. For opus:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiph/opus.git
cd opus
./autogen.sh
# If autogen.sh isn't present or fails, try:
autoreconf -fi
./configure
make
make install
cd ..
```

3. Install libsodium:
```bash
pkg install libsodium
```

4. Now for toxcore with git submodules:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore.git
cd c-toxcore
# Initialize and update git submodules
git submodule init
git submodule update
./autogen.sh
./configure AR=ar PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/pkgconfig
make
make install
cd ..
```

5. Finally tuntox:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjedeer/tuntox.git
cd tuntox
make
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` commands before building toxcore
2. This will properly fetch the cmp dependency that was missing

If you encounter any other errors, please share them and I'll help resolve them.

 Ah yes, we need to specify the correct installation prefix for Termux. By default, it's trying to install to /usr/local which isn't accessible in Termux. Let me fix the instructions:

1. Basic build tools:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install git make clang pkg-config autoconf automake libtool binutils
```

2. For opus:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xiph/opus.git
cd opus
./autogen.sh
# If autogen.sh isn't present or fails, try:
autoreconf -fi
./configure --prefix=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr
make
make install
cd ..
```

3. Install libsodium:
```bash
pkg install libsodium
```

4. Now for toxcore:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore.git
cd c-toxcore
# Initialize and update git submodules
git submodule init
git submodule update
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr AR=ar PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/pkgconfig
make
make install
cd ..
```

5. Finally tuntox:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjedeer/tuntox.git
cd tuntox
make
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `--prefix=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr` to both opus and toxcore configure commands
2. This ensures installation goes to the correct Termux directory instead of /usr/local

If you encounter any other errors, please share them and I'll help resolve them.

 This is an issue with libtool's hardcoded paths. We need to modify the build system to handle Termux's non-standard paths. Let's try this approach:

1. First clean up previous build attempts:
```bash
cd c-toxcore
make distclean
```

2. Then we need to modify the libtool configuration. Create a new file called `config.site` in your home directory:
```bash
echo "lt_cv_sys_lib_dlsearch_path_spec='/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib'" > ~/config.site
```

3. Now try building again with the modified environment:
```bash
CONFIG_SITE=~/config.site ./autogen.sh
CONFIG_SITE=~/config.site ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX \
    --with-libdir=$PREFIX/lib \
    AR=ar \
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig \
    lt_cv_sys_lib_search_path_spec=$PREFIX/lib \
    lt_cv_sys_lib_dlsearch_path_spec=$PREFIX/lib
make
make install
```

If this still fails, we can try an alternative approach where we patch the libtool script after it's generated. Would you like me to provide that alternative if this attempt doesn't work?

Also, could you share any error message you get from these new instructions so I can better diagnose the issue?

 Great! Despite the ldconfig warning (which is expected on Termux), the installation was actually successful. Now let's proceed with building tuntox:

1. First, we need to ensure tuntox can find the installed toxcore libraries. Set up the environment variables:
```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib
```

2. Then build tuntox:
```bash
cd ~/tuntox
make CFLAGS="-I$PREFIX/include" LDFLAGS="-L$PREFIX/lib"
```

In case you get any linking errors with tuntox, try this alternative command:
```bash
make CFLAGS="-I$PREFIX/include" LDFLAGS="-L$PREFIX/lib -ltoxcore"
```

Let me know if you get any errors and I'll help you resolve them. Once tuntox is built successfully, we can discuss how to use it since it will require root access or proper capabilities to create TUN interfaces.

 The issue is that pkg-config isn't finding toxcore. Let's fix this by directly specifying the path and making sure the environment is properly set up:

1. First, let's modify the Makefile again to explicitly handle the linking:
```bash
cat > Makefile << 'EOF'
CFLAGS += -g -Wall -I$(PREFIX)/include
LDFLAGS += -L$(PREFIX)/lib -ltoxcore -ltoxencryptsave -lsodium -lm
OBJECTS = cJSON.o client.o gitversion.o log.o main.o tox_bootstrap_json.o util.o

all: tuntox

gitversion.h:
	echo "#define GITVERSION \"$(shell git describe --always --dirty 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)\"" > $@

%.o: %.c gitversion.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

tuntox: $(OBJECTS)
	$(CC) -o $@ $(OBJECTS) $(LDFLAGS)

clean:
	rm -f tuntox *.o gitversion.h
EOF
```

2. Make sure the environment is correctly set:
```bash
export PREFIX=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/lib
```

3. Verify that toxcore.pc exists and is readable:
```bash
ls -l $PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig/libtoxcore.pc
```

4. Clean and rebuild:
```bash
make clean
make
```

If you still get errors, let's try an alternative approach by directly compiling without using make:

```bash
cc -o tuntox *.c -I$PREFIX/include -L$PREFIX/lib -ltoxcore -ltoxencryptsave -lsodium -lm \
   -DGITVERSION=\"$(git describe --always --dirty 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)\"
```

Let me know which error you get and I'll help you resolve it.
